## 🧾 Project Overview

Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a Lagos-based retail company specializing in office supplies, furniture, and technology. The company operates across various customer segments, including individual consumers, small businesses, and corporate clients.

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I was tasked with analyzing order data (2009–2012) for the Abuja division of KMS. The goal was to answer business-critical questions using SQL, generate insights from the data, and recommend strategies for increasing profitability, reducing costs, and improving customer experience.

## 🗃️ Dataset Description

The project was based on two main CSV files:

| File Name                | Description                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `KMS_Sql_Case_Study.csv` | Contains all sales orders and details      |
| `Order_Status.csv`       | Contains orders marked as "Returned" only  |

These files were imported into a SQL Server database and structured into two tables:

- `[KMS-ORDERS]` – Main transaction data
*TOTAL ROWS: 8399*
*TOTAL COLUMNS: 21*
- `ORDER_STATUS` – Returned order data
 *TOTAL COLUMNS: 572*

   → Top customers were mostly large-scale buyers of Furniture, Technology and Office Supplies. They include; Emily Phan (117124.4), Deborah Brumfield (97433.1), Roy Skaria(92542.2), Sylvia Foulston(88875.8), Grant Carroll (88417). this analysis Helps target repeat buyers with personalized offers.

7. **Which small business customer had the highest sales?**  

   → *Dennis Kane* was the highest spender among Small Business clients with total sales of 75967.6.

8. **Which corporate customer placed the most orders from 2009 to 2012?**

   → *Adam Hart* had the highest order count in the Corporate segment, with 27 total orders.

9. **Which consumer customer was the most profitable?**  
Q9: MOST PROFITABLE CONSUMER CUSTOMER---

```sql
SELECT top 1 [CUSTOMER_NAME], SUM (PROFIT) AS TOTALPROFIT
FROM [KMS-ORDERS]
WHERE [CUSTOMER_SEGMENT] = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY [CUSTOMER_NAME]
ORDER BY TOTALPROFIT DESC;
```
   → *Emily Phan* yielded the highest profit in the Consumer segment, with a Total profit of 34005.4.

10. **Which customers returned items, and what segments do they belong to?**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT o.[Customer_Name], o.[CUSTOMER_Segment]
FROM [KMS-ORDERS] o
JOIN ORDER_STATUS r ON o.[Order_ID] = r.[Order_ID];
```

   → Returned items were recorded across all segments, notably Corporate and Small Business and a few from Home Office and Consumer.


11. **Is shipping cost aligned with order priority?**  

   → Contuary to the question, after analysis, the Shipping mode with the most shipping cost was **Delivery Truck** and the Shipping mode with the least was **Express Air**.
 
**BUT** if the Delivery Truck was the least expensive, then *No.* Most of the orders, regardless of priority made use of methods like Delivery Truck, which definetly took a lot of time, especially for the Critical and high priority orders. Therefore, there was no significant correlation of the shipping cost or mode with Order priority, indicating a mismatch between cost and urgency. 

*ALTHOUGH* as Express air was the shipping mode with the least shipping cost, the answer is still NO, the company most definetly spent the shipping cost appropriately IN.

***Insight***: I Suggest aligning shipping mode with order priority to save costs.

##  Project Overview

Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a Lagos-based retail company specializing in office supplies, furniture, and technology. The company operates across various customer segments, including individual consumers, small businesses, and corporate clients.

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I was tasked with analyzing order data (2009‚Äì2012) for the Abuja division of KMS. The goal was to answer business-critical questions using SQL, generate insights from the data, and recommend strategies for increasing profitability, reducing costs, and improving customer experience.

##  Dataset Description

The project was based on two main CSV files:

| File Name                | Description                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `KMS_Sql_Case_Study.csv` | Contains all sales orders and details      |
| `Order_Status.csv`       | Contains orders marked as "Returned" only  |

These files were imported into a SQL Server database and structured into two tables:

`[KMS-ORDERS]` ‚Äì Main transaction data
- *TOTAL ROWS: 8399*
- *TOTAL COLUMNS: 21*

`ORDER_STATUS` ‚Äì Returned order data
- *TOTAL ROWS: 572*

###  **Case Scenario 2: Customer Behavior**

6. **Who are the most valuable customers, and what do they typically purchase?**  
 
   ‚Üí Top customers were mostly large-scale buyers of Furniture, Technology and Office Supplies.

They include; Emily Phan (117124.4), Deborah Brumfield (97433.1), Roy Skaria(92542.2), Sylvia Foulston(88875.8), Grant Carroll (88417). this analysis Helps target repeat buyers with personalized offers.

7. **Which small business customer had the highest sales?**  

   ‚Üí *Dennis Kane* was the highest spender among Small Business clients with total sales of 75967.6.

8. **Which corporate customer placed the most orders from 2009 to 2012?**

   ‚Üí *Adam Hart* had the highest order count in the Corporate segment, with 27 total orders.

9. **Which consumer customer was the most profitable?**  

```sql
SELECT top 1 [CUSTOMER_NAME], SUM (PROFIT) AS TOTALPROFIT
FROM [KMS-ORDERS]
WHERE [CUSTOMER_SEGMENT] = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY [CUSTOMER_NAME]
ORDER BY TOTALPROFIT DESC;
```
   ‚Üí *Emily Phan* yielded the highest profit in the Consumer segment, with a Total profit of 34005.4.

10. **Which customers returned items, and what segments do they belong to?**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT o.[Customer_Name], o.[CUSTOMER_Segment]
FROM [KMS-ORDERS] o
JOIN ORDER_STATUS r ON o.[Order_ID] = r.[Order_ID];
```

   ‚Üí Returned items were recorded across all segments, notably Corporate and Small Business and a few from Home Office and Consumer.


11. **Is shipping cost aligned with order priority?**  

   ‚Üí Contuary to the question, after analysis, the Shipping mode with the most shipping cost was **Delivery Truck** and the Shipping mode with the least was **Express Air**.
 
**BUT** if the Delivery Truck was the least expensive, then *No.* Most of the orders, regardless of priority made use of methods like Delivery Truck, which definetly took a lot of time, especially for the Critical and high priority orders. Therefore, there was no significant correlation of the shipping cost or mode with Order priority, indicating a mismatch between cost and urgency. 

*ALTHOUGH* as Express air was the shipping mode with the least shipping cost, the answer is still NO, the company most definetly spent the shipping cost appropriately IN.

***Insight***: I Suggest aligning shipping mode with order priority to save costs.

##  Key Recommendations

-  **Double down on top categories** like Technology, which consistently drive revenue.
-  **Target low-value customers** with discounts, personalized offers, and engagement campaigns.
-  **Review shipping strategies** to ensure low-priority orders use more economical methods.
-  **Invest in underperforming regions** through localized marketing and product adaptation.
-  **Track returned items per segment** to identify quality or satisfaction issues.
